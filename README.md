   **Agentic AI & Automation for Compounding Operational Leverage**  
   Turning workflows into intelligent, measurable systems that accelerate growth.
</div>

## 🚀 Who We Are
DuoLio partners with modern teams to design, build and operationalize agentic AI systems: autonomous / semi‑autonomous agents, LLM‑augmented workflows, voice & chat interfaces, and predictive intelligence layers that directly reduce cost, cycle time, and manual error.

We focus on engineering depth over hype: reproducible data, reliable evaluation, observable runtime behavior, and continuous optimization loops.

## 💡 What We Deliver
| Domain | Outcomes |
|--------|----------|
| AI Automation / Agents | Task orchestration, tool use, safe reasoning loops |
| LLM Integration | RAG pipelines, prompt architectures, guardrails, evaluation harnesses |
| NLP & Conversational Interfaces | Chat & voice assistants, semantic search, context tracking |
| Predictive Modeling | Forecasting, anomaly & churn detection, scoring services |
| ML Pipelines | Ingestion, feature stores, batch + streaming orchestration |
| Model Optimization | Latency & cost reduction (quantization, distillation, pruning) |
| Workflow Orchestration | n8n / custom orchestrators, triggers, queue & API chaining |
| Responsible & Eval | Bias / hallucination checks, regression & quality dashboards |

## 🧭 Engagement Models
| Tier | Designed For | Snapshot |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Starter | One high‑leverage workflow | Rapid discovery → build → launch + light monitoring |
| Growth ("Growth Engine") | Multi‑workflow expansion | Parallel automation, conversational layer, proactive optimization |
| Enterprise | Scale, compliance, bespoke SLAs | Dedicated architect, custom infra, deep integration stack |

## 🔁 Delivery Framework
1. Opportunity Mapping (data, impact, feasibility)  
2. Architecture Blueprint (agents / models / data flows)  
3. Build & Instrument (pipelines, prompts, evaluation hooks)  
4. Deploy & Observe (cost, latency, drift, hallucination, safety)  
5. Optimize & Compound (A/B prompting, model swaps, tool expansion)  

## 🛠 Core Stack & Patterns
- LLMs: OpenAI, Anthropic, local quantized models (GGUF)  
- Retrieval: hybrid vector + keyword (FAISS / pgvector / custom)  
- Pipelines: Python, Node, n8n, lightweight orchestrators  
- Data: Feature stores, streaming ingestion (Webhooks, Kafka-like services)  
- Evaluation: golden sets, adversarial probes, hallucination scoring  
- Optimization: profiling, caching, distillation, quantization, adaptive routing  
- Observability: structured logs, cost + latency dashboards, feedback loops  

## 🧪 Quality & Reliability Principles
- Guardrail first: content policy, safety filters, bounded tool execution  
- Deterministic reproducibility: versioned prompts, data snapshots  
- Progressive hardening: synthetic edge cases + replay suites  
- Human feedback incorporation & regression gating  

## 🔒 Responsible AI Practices
Bias scans · PII redaction pathways · transparency logs · selective model fallback · rate & cost controls.

## 🗓 Booking
Use the “Book an Appointment” form on the site to request a 30‑minute discovery session. We respond within one business day.

## 📬 Contact
- Website: https://duolio.vercel.app/  
- Email: duolio.ai@gmail.com  
- (Optional) Add your details via the on‑site form – stored securely in our internal Notion workspace.

## 🤝 Why Teams Choose DuoLio
- Outcome alignment (we start with measurable impact hypotheses)  
- Fast iteration loops (experimentation to production)  
- Observability baked in (cost / quality / safety from day one)  
- Flexible engagement path (expand as value is proven)  

## 🔐 Data & Privacy
We only retain minimal metadata necessary for follow‑up unless a formal engagement begins. All evaluation datasets are anonymized / synthetic unless otherwise contractually defined.

## 🧾 Light Technical Note (For Integrators)
The site uses a serverless endpoint (`/api/contact`) that writes appointment requests to a Notion database (Title, Email, Focus, Message, etc.). Honeypot field prevents basic spam bots. No additional persistence layer is active by default.
